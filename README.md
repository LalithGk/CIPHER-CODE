# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

Welcome to the **Caesar Cipher** project! This is a simple yet fascinating encryption algorithm that has been used for centuries to secure messages. 🏛️✨

## 📜 About the Caesar Cipher
The **Caesar Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet. Julius Caesar himself reportedly used it to communicate with his generals! ⚔️

For example, with a shift of **3**:
- **HELLO** → **KHOOR**

## 🚀 Features
✅ Encrypts and decrypts messages with a specified shift value 🔢
✅ Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters 🔤
✅ Ignores non-alphabet characters (spaces, numbers, symbols) ✨
✅ Simple and easy-to-understand implementation 📜

## 📂 Project Structure
```
CIPHER-CODE/
├── caesar_cipher.py  # The main Python script
├── README.md         # This file 😃
└── examples/         # Sample encrypted & decrypted text
```

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LalithGk/CIPHER-CODE.git
cd CIPHER-CODE
```
Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Enter a message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Choose a shift value (e.g., `3`).
3. The script will encrypt or decrypt the message accordingly!
4. Handles spaces and ensures correct letter shifting.

## 🎨 Example Usage
```
Enter the text: Hello World!
Enter the Leap of alphabets: 3
Encrypted message: khoor zruog!
Decrypted message: hello world!
```
